I am currently working as an Integrated Avionics specialist with the USAF. Maintaining and managing RHEL and integrated Unix systems.

Cyber security and IT is my passion!  
Every day I strive to learn something new or make things better with the knowledge I've gained. Consistently working on refining my skills and techniques through homelab and CTFs.
