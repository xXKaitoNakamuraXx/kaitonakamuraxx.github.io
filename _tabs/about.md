# About
---

I am currently working as an Integrated Avionics specialist on MQ-9's with the USAF. Maintaining and managing RHEL and integrated Unix systems on and off the aircraft.

Cyber security and IT is my passion!  
Every day I strive to learn something new or make things better with the knowledge I've gained. Consistently working on refining my skills and techniques through homelab and CTFs. 

If you would like to join / follow me in my journey, or just chat n' hack feel free to follow or message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-biddle-165b8b211) or [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/B4ndw1d7h)

Here are my primary areas of knowledge so far. While my stats are starting to looking good I still have plenty to learn across the board and cant wait to learn all those "unknown unknowns" ;P
