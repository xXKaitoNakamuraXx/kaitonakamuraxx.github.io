## Reason

The reason I decided that I needed to have a homelab is so I can get hands on with many different technologies and put my skills to the test. 



## How I started

Not having a lot of money for an actual server to work with I took bits and pieces from old desktop parts I had lying around, and parts given to me by friends that had upgraded their gaming PC's. all together I was able to get a decent starting system together.
